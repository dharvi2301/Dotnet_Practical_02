# Customer Account Management in C#

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple **Customer Account Management System** using C#. It defines a `Customer_Account` class that stores **customer details**, including the bank name, account number, and customer name. The class provides methods to **set the bank name** and **display account details**. The `Main` method in the `Program` class creates an instance of `Customer_Account`, assigns values, and prints the account details to the console.

## Features
- **Encapsulates** customer account details in a class.
- Implements a **parameterized constructor** to initialize account details.
- Provides a **method to set the bank name**.
- Displays customer details using a **print method**.
- Uses **OOP principles** like **Encapsulation, Abstraction, and Constructors**.

## Below is the output when the Customer Account Console Application is executed:
